# ESP8266 Sensor Node

Implements the same API to retrieve sensor data as the 
[Rails application](https://github.com/railsgirlssb/humure).


## WiFi Passwords

The file ```wifi_password.h``` contains your sensible WiFi password.
Your can ignore the changes you did on the file by setting this explicitly:

```
git update-index --assume-unchanged */wifi_password.h
```
